            Cataract surgery is an "ambulatory" procedure - you walk in and walk out afterwards. The entire experience may take between two and three hours from check-in to check-out, but the procedure itself is usually over in less than an hour.

            If you're feeling nervous about lens replacement for your cataracts, keep in mind-modern cataract surgery is one of the safest and most effective medical procedures performed today. It helps millions of people each year in the India alone to regain vision. It may also make you feel more confident if you know what you can expect every step of the way-from your initial evaluation to the day of the surgery.
