        <p>
            Many people in their 50s, 60s and 70s realise that their vision is changing without recognizing that cataracts may be the cause. Cataracts develop slowly and painlessly so that your vision and lifestyle can be affected without your realizing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern cataract surgery is a routine procedure with extraordinary benefits. Not surprisingly, most patients are very satisfied after cataract surgery. Most patients experience little or no pain and return to their normal activities the day after surgery. And now, thanks to advances in technology, cataract treatment can even correct other conditions, including nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism and presbyopia and reduce your dependence on glasses or contact lenses.
