            After your cataract surgery is over, you're well on your way to better vision! Most patients are already excited by their new vision the day after surgery. But your vision will continue to improve gradually as your eyes heal and your brain adjusts to using your new lens.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, you’ll find some general guidelines for what to expect immediately after cataract surgery and in the following weeks and months, as well as some tips for adjusting to your new lenses and some information about possible cataract surgery risks, side effects and rare complications from cataract surgery.

If you have any discharge, use a warm washcloth to wipe it away gently. Your doctor will tell you what is normal to expect. It is usually okay to resume light activities like reading, writing, watching TV and walking. You may be tempted to do more but take it easy while your body recovers.
