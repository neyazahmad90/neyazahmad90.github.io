            LASIK is an “ambulatory” procedure-you walk in and walk out afterwards. The entire experience may take between two and three hours from check-in to check-out, but the procedure itself is usually over in less than an hour.<br>
            If you’re feeling nervous about having laser vision correction, keep in mind-LASIK has the highest patient satisfaction rate of any elective surgery: 95.4%, according to a 10-year survey of scientific studies from around the world. It may also make you feel more confident if you know what you can expect every step of the way-from your initial LASIK evaluation to the day of the surgery.
            Below are detailed descriptions of the initial examination and surgical procedure your doctor will perform in order to evaluate and then correct your vision with LASIK.

                                                side effects.

                                                may give a mild oral sedative, as well, to help
