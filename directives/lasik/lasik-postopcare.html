            Most LASIK patients say their eyes feel fairly normal even by the first day after surgery and are happy with their vision immediately. However, your vision will usually get even better as your eyes heal. The possibility of better vision without glasses or contacts is always exciting. LASIK does require careful preparation and care afterwards.
            <br>
            Most people feel fine after LASIK surgery, and others feel nothing worse than mild discomfort. You may feel mild burning or itching, your eyes may water and the whites may look red or bloodshot. These are all normal symptoms of recovery. Your doctor
            may prescribe a mild pain reliever, along with antibiotic drops to help with healing.
