            Studies show that the majority of patients obtain 20/20 vision or even better after LASIK surgery & nearly all patients achieve 20/40.
            <br> Patients are often amazed by the clarity of their vision the day after surgery, but your visual experience after LASIK may be slightly different than with corrective lenses. While there are great benefits of LASIK, as with any refractive surgery, there are also short-term side effects you may experience as you recover. You may also still occasionally need to wear corrective lenses to achieve the sharpest possible vision. Of course, the benefits of your own LASIK surgery will depend on many personal factors. Your age, health and degree of refractive error, as well as the technology used will all affect the results of your procedure.

                            who have had LASIK surgery show that after nine

                            complications for severely farsighted patients. Almost all LASIK complications are treatable, but
                            discuss this carefully with your doctor.

                            Farsighted eyes generally recover more slowly than
                            nearsighted eyes, so your surgeon may wish to
                            treat one eye and wait a few days to weeks before
                            treating the other. It may also take longer for you
                            to achieve your best vision while your eyes heal.

                            LASIK surgery has been shown to be very effective
                            in treating mild to moderate astigmatism up to 4
                            diopters. The benefits of LASIK you can realistically
                            look forward to will depend on the exact nature and
                            degree of your astigmatism, however, and whether
                            you have other refractive errors.

                            may recommend that you have LASIK surgery with
                            an additional procedure, such as limbal relaxing 
                            Incisions, to better correct your vision.
