            PRELEX is performed in our day surgery. The eye is anaesthetised with eye drops to ensure patient comfort during the procedure.  A micro-incision (of 2.5mm or less) is made in the eye so that the natural lens can be removed using ultrasonic vibrations. The natural lens is replaced by a foldable multifocal intraocular lens, which is inserted through the micro-incision. Once inside the eye, the lens unfolds as it is placed into permanent position. No stitches are required because the tiny micro-incision is self-sealing.

        	For those patients who have some degree of corneal astigmatism requiring additional correction, relaxing incisions can be made in the surface of the cornea to reduce the astigmatism at the same time PRELEX is performed.  Alternatively, the astigmatism can be corrected on a separate occasion with a laser or limbal relaxing incisions.

        	Although everyone heals differently, most patients see improvement in their vision almost immediately and most resume normal activities within a day or two.
