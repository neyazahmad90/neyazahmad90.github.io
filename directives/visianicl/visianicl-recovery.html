	             The Visian ICL Collamer material enables our insertion method to be minimally invasive. With only a 3.5 mm insert, we can optimize the procedure and recovery time dramatically. Additionally, the procedure is also painless because of the numbing medication. Patients can usually expect a 20-30 minute procedure or less and most people are able to resume daily activities in just a few short days with clearer vision.
